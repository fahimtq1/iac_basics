# IaC with Ansible

## What is Ansible?

Ansible is a software tool used for the automation of IaC configurations. It is an agentless software, meaning it doesn't require any of it's agent nodes to have the Ansible software installed on them in order to interact with them. One of the most powerful aspects of Ansible is that it allows the configuration of a network of computers at once.
